Project to automaticaly create report from an excel file. It is still in
development. The idea is to create PDF files from a xlsx or xslm file depending
on some configuration file. The configuration file define which product to add
to the document, which parameters and also some other custom design possibilities.
The values writen in the excel file are random and/or obsolete. Nothing can be
done with it.
